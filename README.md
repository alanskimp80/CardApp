# iOS CardApp with Swift 5


## Overview

This is a simple card-view app where the user can add data and display the information
as separate cards in the home screen. Currently the prefect screen size to test this demo app is iPhone 8, though it should work fine on the iPhone 11 as well.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Mac running macOS Mojave/Catalina
- Xcode 11.3

### Installation

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Run the simulator eg. iPhone 8 or 11

### Extra Features

Given time I would create and a few more Unit tests and also size the app across all the iphone screen sizes. The option to upload a custom image per card would also be nice. 

thanks!
